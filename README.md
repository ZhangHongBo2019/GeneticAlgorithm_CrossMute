# Preface
This branch mainly includes the operation mechanism of genetic algorithm, including selection, crossover, mutation, and recombination. The algorithms involved include general genetic algorithms and improved genetic algorithms such as NSGA-II. The specific issue is the TSP issue, which is one objective problem. It also includes a specific project for the elevator industry and the decoration industry, both of which involve multi-objective problems.
